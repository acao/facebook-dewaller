# Set up

`yarn` to install web-ext

# Run

`yarn run` will execute `web-ext run` locally, loading the extension in your  local firefox browser

# How it works

Literally its one CSS block with one line of style at this point. 

# Potential Issues
Even with a normal logged-out firefox session, I still get prompted here and there to prove my non-roboticness. Wondering if a delayed click to the already hidden 'No Thanks' button would help that? Gonna try this soon.


# Up Next
- confirm it works in Firefox for Android (different selectors for m.facebook?), maybe.. TorFox? Tor?
- expose page/people/etc? search in top navigation
- the login dropdown that opens at random would be nice to reign in
- write tests that prove it works... in desktop and firefox for android?
